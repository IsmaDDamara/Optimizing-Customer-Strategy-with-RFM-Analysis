# üìä Optimizing Customer Strategy with RFM Analysis

## üìå Background

In today‚Äôs business landscape, understanding customer behavior is essential for enhancing loyalty and profitability. One effective method for customer segmentation is **RFM Analysis**‚Äîwhich stands for **Recency**, **Frequency**, and **Monetary**. RFM allows businesses to categorize customers based on how recently they made a purchase (Recency), how often they purchase (Frequency), and how much they spend (Monetary). With this segmentation, companies can tailor marketing strategies to be more targeted and personalized.

## üéØ Project Objectives

The objectives of this project are to perform customer segmentation based on RFM values in order to:

* Identify groups of loyal, potential, or at-risk customers.
* Provide insights to the marketing team for more effective campaign targeting.
* Support data-driven business decisions based on customer behavior.

## üß≠ Analysis Steps

1. **Data Collection**

   * Transaction dataset including customer ID, transaction dates, and purchase amounts.

2. **Data Cleaning**

   * Handle missing values and duplicates
   * Convert date formats
   * Filter out irrelevant or test data

3. **RFM Calculation**

   * **Recency**: Days since the last transaction from a reference date
   * **Frequency**: Number of transactions per customer
   * **Monetary**: Total amount spent by each customer

4. **RFM Scoring**

   * Assign scores from 1‚Äì5 for each RFM component based on quantiles
   * Combine scores to create RFM segments

5. **Customer Segmentation**

   * Group customers into segments such as:
     **Champions**, **Loyal Customers**, **Potential Loyalists**, **At Risk**, **Lost Customers**

6. **Visualization & Interactive Dashboard**

   * Display segment distributions, segment-level statistics, and other actionable insights
